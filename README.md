# BadgerPrivacyPolicy
Privacy Policy for Badger

Badger, for stats, collects some data upon installing/updating/downgrading the tweak. This data is not personal info, don't worry, just general data we use for stats and I've highlighted it all in here.

# Your collected data
- Name of tweak (will likely be Badger of course, since that's what you're installing)
- Version of the tweak you're installing (ex, if you're installing 1.0.0, it will log "1.0.0")
- iOS version the tweak is being installed on (ex with iOS 14.3, will log "14.3")
- Device model the tweak is being installed on (ex on a iPad 6th Gen Wifi-Only model, it will log "J71bAP")
- iOS build version the tweak is being installed on
- **HASHED** ECID. Badger does *not* normally collect your ECID, rather it hashes it and sends the first few characters of that hash to us. (An example is that we can use this data to track how many installs of an update were new installs or existing users that update, how often existing users update the tweak, etc without sending your raw ECID/UUID to us).
- Attempts to detect if the device is rootless, and submits the result

# Clarifications
- If you deliberately send data to us that is not listed here, send data in a binary other than the one I/we have provided, I/we are not responsable for the data you send to us. So no, (as an example which does not reflect upon everything this clarification is responsible for) you can't on purpose modify and make the name of the tweak your address, send data and attempt to sue us for not listing we'd collect that, you're modifying and sending data we usually don't collect and blaming it on us. I'm pretty sure I/We *should* be fine from this even without this clarification, but just adding it to make sure.

- We may potentially send less than the information listed here. (Example, not reflecting of everything this clarification is responsible for: If getting build version fails, Badger may not send it)

- This privacy policy may potentially be modified in the future. Whenever you install/update badger, you are agreeing to the newest form of the Badger Privacy Policy that is in place at that point in time.
